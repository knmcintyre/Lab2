# Lab 2: Heritage Buildings of Victoria 

A screenshot of an area of the map which I find interesting: ![alt text](https://knmcintyre.github.io/Lab2/mapsegment2.png "Interesting Map Segment")

Here we can see how the locations of the heritage buildings is more dense in comparison to other areas of the city.

Collaborators:
For this project, I used my roommate to suggest improvements upon the map design. They suggested that I changed a few of the details to make the inset map more significant and the land cover which is visible in the inset map more visually appealing. This led to the darkening of the colour of the US-Canadian border, because the prior colour made it too similar to the colour of the major highways which is still visible on this map which was visually confusing. They also suggested that I darken the colour of the city border, because it originally blended into the the map in some places. ChatGPT was used to suggest solutions to any errors in the code and pointed out a few spelling mistakes which caused some problems for me along the way. Other than that, the development of the code for creating this map came from what is available on the mapbox website and suggestions from online forums and what was shown in class. 

# Reflective Analysis
This map was developed for anyone who may have interest in historical architecture in the city of Victoria. The buildings that are included in this map are not all of the heritage buildings in the city, but the major ones of note which happen to be larger and not residential. Creating a map of the residential heritage buildings may have been problematic in the security of those living in those bulidings. With these buildings classified as significant heritage buildings, they automatically are of more interest to those which may want to become more familiar with such structures and their heritage. This map would be made available to those living within the city and outside of it, so it was important to include street names and geographical names of significance to help with personal orientation in the area as well as improving the map user's familiarity with the city. 

By looking at this map, one may question why these heritage buildings are located where they are located. It may bring up questions like: "How old is the city of Victoria?" "Why is there a denser cluster of heritage buildings in the downtown region?" "What kind of major buildings are being given the heritage status and why?" "How can I get from heritage building to heritage building to better understand the area?" This inspires more research and engagement with the city and its history. 

This map makes navigating the city easier as it considers more than just the location of these heritage buildings. The user can use this map to follow road ways, zoom in to see the location of buildings, the division between different uses of city (ex. commercial or industrial), significant water bodies, and the city boundary. Including the city boundary was very important to me, because even those who live in Victoria may think that the neighbourhood of Victoria is actually larger than it is in actuality. With this layer included, the viewer can see where the city's area ends, which is helpful considering that there is much more land that is often confused with the Victoria area, as it is often referred to as "Greater Victoria." Because of this layer's inclusion, including a legend was important to help signify what the bordered area was actually representing. It may have also been helpful to include the polygon shape colour representing the heritage buildings in the legend as well, but because these polygons are interactive and the map's title is clear, it seemed less necessary in comparison, as it is more self explanatory.

Including an inset map was significant for orientation for the map viewer, especially if they weren't familiar with where Victoria is in relation to other cities in BC or just where Victoria even is in general. This inset map is static and shows the west coast of Canada and the US, with two major cities, Seattle and Vancouver in view. This can familiarize the location of Victoria to both Americans and Canadians because these cities are very well known. The pointer works to show the precise coordinates of Victoria for better spatial comprehension. I was hoping to also include a north arrow but ran into some serious issues with that despite several attempts.

When comparing this map to my map produced in Lab 1, this map is much more comprehensible because it has less data to display and is showing a more defined area that is visually easy to understand. The basemap compliments the data displayed by being simple but also articulating information to the viewer. The location of water is significant in defining Victoria's shape, the roads are significant for explaining how people move throughout it and how a viewer may move through it, the place names help with defining significant areas and why the city is the way that it is. There is distinction between different land uses, showing parks, commercial areas, and industrial areas which can help explain the way that the city is organized. Being able to zoom in and out can help with better understanding the area of focus, especially those around the heritage buildings. Being able to click on the buildings brings up their name which can share a lot of information with the viewer and inspire them to look into any given building of interest in more detail. I also was careful in including the ability for the mouse to change to a pointer when over top of the heritage buildings layer, representing to the viewer that those polygons could be clicked on to share more information. 

I carefully chose the colours of this map to better represent a map style that is more commonly seen in professional settings. In my previous lab assignment I chose a pink/purple colour palette when developing my map, but that style is not very commonly seen. I wanted to be more creative. For this lab I wanted to emulate something that is more relatable to viewers by using a beige base and carefully matching the other land uses with that palette. I made sure to make everything have a muted undertone so nothing stood out too much in comparison to what the points of focus were supposed to be. I carefully considered the colours of industrial areas, water bodies, parks, etc. and made it so everything blended well together but still showed definition between land use types. I used a brighter colour for both the city border and the heritage buildings to make them pop and heighten their visual hierarchy. 

For this map, the area of focus is relatively smaller, especially when considering the last lab project. I learned from the prior lab that a big dataset and a wide area of interest makes everything more complicated when it comes to displaying things meaningfully and also as a viewer for understanding what is being shown. I think this map is a stronger display of cartographic skill; information is not being bogged down or lost. The data of focus can shine through and those using the map can navigate the area in a meaningful way.

This map is not really made to be zoomed out very much which is why there is an inset map included. Zooming in does offer advanced knowledge, showing specific road names, walk ways, and the areas around heritage buildings which is significant in understanding why certain buildings are located in certain areas. I organized the layers, land uses, and colours in ways that would change slightly when zooming in or out which can advance the understanding of buildings and the area as a whole.  

Despite the significant amount of time, effort, and research that was put into developing this map, some of the pop ups do not seem to work. This is a drawback in the overall display but was a very complex problem that seemed unfixable based on the data used to produce the map. There seems to be 3 buildings which don't work which are located in the downtown area of Victoria, one of which I know is the Parliament Buildings. Considering the size of the area of interest and the problems with the data, in hindsight it might have been better to do this map with a similar dataset for the city of Vancouver. This could have made the map more advanced and led to some more interesting and accurate displays of data, especially when considering the diversity of land use in the Vancouver area. When looking at the border of the city, it personally does seem a little too bright. Fixing this was a a bit of a tricky problem because it covered so much area and went over so many different land use types. It was necessary to find a balance for the colour of the border that contrasted enough with every land type it went over without also standing out too much, but I'm not sure if this was entirely successful.
